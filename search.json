    "text": "Baseball’s popularity has been dwindling for decades. There are many theories about the reason for the decline blaming everything from competition with other sports and the rise of television to trends in the game itself.\nWhile the real cause is likely a combination of many factors, Major League Baseball can only change what happens within its league to combat baseball’s shrinking fan base. So that’s exactly what it did.\nThe 2023 season was the first year a multitude of new rules were implemented after testing those changes in the minor leagues. The MLB sought to make the game more exciting and much faster — the average game length jumped to over three hours in the 2010s.\nOne area of inaction the MLB hoped to change was the basepath. Stolen base attempts have decreased drastically in the past few decades and even noticeably declined in the last 10 years. New disengagement rules for pitchers essentially limited fake and real pickoff attempts to just two per plate appearance. Base size also increased by three inches from 15 to 18, aiming to reduce injuries and increase stolen base attempts.\nNot only did the changes lead to significantly more stolen base attempts in the 2023 season, but the success rate also increased by 5%, possibly because of the pickoff limit.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(scales)\n\nmisc &lt;- read_csv(\"/Users/macbuffington/Documents/JOUR307/Homework/misc.csv\")\nsplits &lt;- read_csv(\"/Users/macbuffington/Documents/JOUR307/Homework/splits.csv\")\nbatting &lt;- read_csv (\"/Users/macbuffington/Documents/JOUR307/Homework/batting.csv\")\n\nbatsums &lt;- batting |&gt; \n  group_by(Season) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    `Stolen Base` = sum(SB),\n    `Caught Stealing` = sum(CS),\n    successrate = `Stolen Base`/(`Caught Stealing` + `Stolen Base`)*100\n  ) |&gt; \n  select(Season, successrate, `Stolen Base`, `Caught Stealing`) |&gt; \n  distinct() \n\nbatsumslong &lt;- batsums |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=contains(\"St\"), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"Stolen\")\n\nrhvrh &lt;- splits |&gt; \n  filter(Split == \"vs RHP as RHB\") |&gt; \n  group_by(Season) |&gt; \n  mutate(totalBA = mean(BA))\n\nlhvrh &lt;- splits |&gt; \n  filter( Split == \"vs LHP as RHB\") |&gt; \n  group_by(Season) |&gt; \n  mutate(totalBA = mean(BA))\n\nrhvlh &lt;- splits |&gt; \n  filter(Split == \"vs RHP as LHB\") |&gt; \n  group_by(Season) |&gt; \n  mutate(totalBA = mean(BA))\n\nlhvlh &lt;- splits |&gt; \n  filter(Split == \"vs LHP as LHB\") |&gt; \n  group_by(Season) |&gt; \n  mutate(totalBA = mean(BA))\n\nmisc2021 &lt;-\n  misc |&gt; \n  filter(Year &gt; 1999,\n         Year != 2021)\n\nmisc2000 &lt;-\n  misc |&gt; \n  filter(Year &gt; 1999)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=batsumslong, \n    aes(x=Season, weight=Stolen, fill=Type)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#D50032\", \"#002D72\"))+\n  coord_flip()+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2023, y=250, label=\"80.18%\", size=3, color=\"white\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2022, y=250, label=\"75.40%\", size=3, color=\"white\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2021, y=250, label=\"75.68%\", size=3, color=\"white\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2020, y=250, label=\"75.18%\", size=3, color=\"white\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2019, y=250, label=\"73.26%\", size=3, color=\"white\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2018, y=250, label=\"72.08%\", size=3, color=\"white\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2017, y=250, label=\"73.01%\", size=3, color=\"white\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2016, y=250, label=\"71.72%\", size=3, color=\"white\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2015, y=250, label=\"70.20%\", size=3, color=\"white\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2014, y=250, label=\"72.76%\", size=3, color=\"white\")+\n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Stolen Base Attempts\",\n    title=\"New MLB rules break stolen base slump\",\n    subtitle=\"2023 saw more steal attempts and a higher success rate than previous seasons.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Megan Buffington\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother major change in the 2023 season was the shift ban. Banning the shift was meant to boost batting averages, which dropped to a leaguewide low of .243 last season, the lowest since 1968. Left-handed hitters in particular were in favor of the shift ban as they stood to gain the most from it.\nWhile one season of data isn’t enough to definitively say the shift improved batting averages — as they do fluctuate some from season to season — hitters across the board saw a notable rise, with the exception of right-handed batters against right-handed pitchers.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=rhvrh, aes(x=Season, y=totalBA), color=\"#D50032\") +\n  geom_line(data=lhvrh, aes(x=Season, y=totalBA), color=\"#002D72\") +\n  geom_line(data=rhvlh, aes(x=Season, y=totalBA), color=\"#888B8D\") +\n  geom_line(data=lhvlh, aes(x=Season, y=totalBA), color=\"#212322\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2021.7, y=.257, label=\"LHP vs RHB\", size=3)+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2021, y=.247, label=\"RHP vs RHB\", size=3)+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2020.8, y=.238, label=\"RHP vs LHB\", size=3)+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2019, y=.232, label=\"LHP vs LHB\", size=3)+\n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Batting Average\",\n    title=\"Averages on the rise after shift ban\",\n    subtitle=\"Batting averages rose almost everywhere in 2023, reversing a general downward trend.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Megan Buffington\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text=element_text(size=8),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most significant rule change was the pitch clock. Pitchers had just 15 seconds to start their “motion to deliver” when the bases were empty and 20 seconds with runners on base. The league hoped the pitch clock would help shorten ever-lengthening games, thereby helping increase baseball’s popularity and attendance.\nGame length was definitely impacted. The average game length shortened by 24 minutes compared to the 2022 season, down to 2 hours and 42 minutes, the shortest since 1984. Attendance also notably increased, hitting the 70 million mark for the first time since 2017 — though part of the increase could still be recovery from the pandemic, which dropped attendance to just 45 million.\n\n\nCode\nboth &lt;- ggplot()+  \n  geom_point(data=misc2021, aes(x=Attendance, y=Time), color=\"#212322\") +\n  geom_smooth(data=misc2021, aes(x=Attendance, y=Time), method=\"lm\", color=\"#002D72\", se=FALSE)+\n  scale_x_continuous(labels=comma)+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Attendance\",\n    y=\"Game Length\")+\n  theme_minimal()\n\ntime &lt;- ggplot()+  \n  geom_point(data=misc2000, aes(x=Year, y=Time), color=\"#212322\") +\n  geom_smooth(data=misc2000, aes(x=Year, y=Time), method=\"lm\", color=\"#002D72\", se=FALSE)+\n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Game Length\",\n    title=\"Game length and attendance's inverse relationship\",\n    subtitle=\"Game length decreased by almost 25 minutes and attendance increased by 5 million in 2023.\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),   \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\nattend &lt;- ggplot()+  \n  geom_point(data=misc2021, aes(x=Year, y=Attendance), color=\"#212322\") +\n  geom_smooth(data=misc2021, aes(x=Year, y=Attendance), method=\"lm\", color=\"#002D72\", se=FALSE)+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma)+\n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Attendance\")+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n(time + attend) / both\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor League Baseball was different in 2023. Stadiums were fuller, games were quicker and more stolen bases and a higher batting average created a more exciting game. But time will only tell if these changes are enough to combat the slow death of America’s game."

    "text": "It’s been a rough few years to be a Nebraska football fan. The Cornhuskers haven’t had a winning season since 2016. They haven’t been to a bowl game since that year, and they haven’t won one since 2017. \nThe lack of success is unusual for the program. Nebraska is a college football powerhouse, though to some it may feel like more than a couple of decades since the three championships of the ’90s. Regardless of the reason for the slump, the Huskers haven’t looked like one of the winningest teams in college football for some time now, and it makes game days in Lincoln a bit less exciting.\nBut Nebraska fans feeling let down by their team should know they’re not the only ones. Five of the 30 winningest teams in Division I football are currently in a bowl-game drought of at least three years — including the Huskers.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(scales)\n\nCFB &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBteamhistory.csv\")\n\nCumWin &lt;- CFB |&gt;

Navy has had one winning season since 2016. Colorado went 1-11 last year, and their only bowl game since 2016 came after a 4-2 COVID season. Texas A&M admitted they were struggling when they fired head coach Jimbo Fisher, knowing they would still have to pay him nearly $80 million. Georgia Tech hasn’t been ranked since 2014, the longest streak of these five.\nWhile all have had their struggles, Nebraska’s decline is significantly more notable. For starters, they are actually declining. Texas A&M and Navy’s season win percentages are trending upward, despite their recent lack of bowl game appearances. \n\n\n\nCode\nggplot()+\n  geom_line(data=top301960on, aes(x=Year, y=OverallPct), color=\"lightgrey\")+\n  geom_smooth(data=top301960on, aes(x=Year, y=OverallPct), method = \"lm\", color = \"darkgray\", se = FALSE)+\n  geom_line(data=nu1960on, aes(x=Year, y=OverallPct), color= \"#E41C38\")+\n  geom_smooth(data=nu1960on, aes(x=Year, y=OverallPct), method = \"lm\", color= \"black\", se = FALSE)+\n  geom_line(data=co1960on, aes(x=Year, y=OverallPct))+\n  geom_smooth(data=co1960on, aes(x=Year, y=OverallPct), method = \"lm\", color= \"black\", se = FALSE, alpha = .5)+\n  geom_line(data=gatech1960on, aes(x=Year, y=OverallPct), color =\"#003057\")+\n  geom_smooth(data=gatech1960on, aes(x=Year, y=OverallPct), method = \"lm\", color= \"black\", se = FALSE)+\n  geom_line(data=navy1960on, aes(x=Year, y=OverallPct), color= \"#B5A67C\")+\n  geom_smooth(data=navy1960on, aes(x=Year, y=OverallPct), method = \"lm\", color= \"black\", se = FALSE)+\n  geom_line(data=texam1960on, aes(x=Year, y=OverallPct), color= \"#500000\")+\n  geom_smooth(data=texam1960on, aes(x=Year, y=OverallPct), method = \"lm\", color= \"black\", se = FALSE)+\n  facet_wrap(~factor(School, levels=c(\"Alabama Crimson Tide\", \"Michigan Wolverines\", \"Penn State Nittany Lions\", \"Texas Longhorns\", \"Notre Dame Fighting Irish\", \"Oklahoma Sooners\", \"Nebraska Cornhuskers\", \"Ohio State Buckeyes\", \"Georgia Bulldogs\", \"Tennessee Volunteers\", \"LSU Fighting Tigers\", \"USC Trojans\", \"Clemson Tigers\", \"Auburn Tigers\", \"Texas A&M Aggies\", \"Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets\", \"Wisconsin Badgers\", \"Virginia Tech Hokies\", \"Florida Gators\", \"Minnesota Golden Gophers\", \"Pitt Panthers\", \"Army Black Knights\", \"Arkansas Razorbacks\", \"Navy Midshipmen\", \"Syracuse Orange\", \"West Virginia Mountaineers\", \"Utah Utes\", \"North Carolina Tar Heels\", \"Ole Miss Rebels\", \"Colorado Buffaloes\")), labeller=as_labeller(names))+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels=percent)+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Year\",\n    y=\"Win percentage\",\n    title=\"Huskers' fall steeper than Buffs, Yellow Jackets\",\n    subtitle=\"Nebraska's recent struggles have dragged their trend line down.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Megan Buffington\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text=element_text(size=6),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThough Colorado and Georgia Tech’s win percentages also have a negative trend, their declines aren’t nearly as steep as Nebraska’s. They’ve also been less consistent. While there is a trend, they’ve fluctuated between success and failure in a way Nebraska hasn’t. The Husker’s decline is not the result of a mixed bag; it’s much clearer: They were good, and now they’re bad.\nIt’s also worth noting that Nebraska is a significantly better team than the others, at least historically. They’ve won 128 more games than the next closest team, Texas A&M. \nBut the Huskers are starting to fall behind. In the 2000s, they were third in all-time wins, just barely behind Alabama. In 2014, Nebraska fell to fourth. Today, they’re seventh.\n\n\nCode\nggplot()+\n  geom_step(data=top30full, aes(x=Year, y=CumWin, group=School), color=\"light grey\", alpha=.3)+\n  geom_step(data=nu, aes(x=Year, y=CumWin), color=\"#E41C38\")+\n  geom_step(data=bama, aes(x=Year, y=CumWin), color=\"#828A8F\")+\n  geom_step(data=gatech, aes(x=Year, y=CumWin), color=\"#003057\")+\n  geom_step(data=texam, aes(x=Year, y=CumWin), color=\"#500000\")+\n  geom_step(data=co, aes(x=Year, y=CumWin), color=\"black\")+\n  geom_step(data=navy, aes(x=Year, y=CumWin), color=\"#B5A67C\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2010, 2025))+\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(450, 975))+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Year\",\n    y=\"Total wins\",\n    title=\"Nebraska stands out among bowl-drought-hit top teams\",\n    subtitle=\"The Huskers aren't the only top team in a dry spell, but historically, they're significantly better.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Megan Buffington\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2023.8, y=974, label=\"Alabama\", size=3)+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2023.8, y=882, label=\"Nebraska\", size=3)+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2024, y=775, label=\"Texas A&M\", size=3)+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2024.1, y=740, label=\"Georgia Tech\", size=3)+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2023.5, y=700, label=\"Navy\", size=3)+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2023.7, y=655, label=\"Colorado\", size=3)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nBut AP polls draw the starkest comparison. The Cornhuskers were ranked at the end of every season from 1969 to 2001. Since then, they’ve been ranked just six times. \nNo other top team in a bowl game drought has been ranked that often or for anywhere near that stretch of time. The Aggies are the only team with a postseason ranking streak worth mentioning, and their seven years seem like nothing compared to the Husker’s 32.\n\n\nCode\nnuline &lt;- ggplot()+\n
